we use <script> "text here" </script> 
brackets to insert the javascript code 
which is automatically executed when 
browser procesess the tag


External script

if our code is to large, we can put <script> text </script>
part into different file and just give it source to where executed
for example: <script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
and it will execute script which is on this link

script tags with src attribute  cant have codes inside
