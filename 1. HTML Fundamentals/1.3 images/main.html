    <!-- to link image, we use "src tag and write its name inside"-->
    <img src="based squid.PNG" height="200" width="200">
    <!-- lets say that we dont like the size of our photo . lucky us, we can change it-->
    <!-- we can use height, width tags in img bracket-->
    <!-- height, width tags are written in PIXELS. when we write 200 it means 200 pixel-->
    <!-- for good practice, what happens if the photo we uploaded was not loaded for some1 else-->
    <!-- for that, we use alt Tag to show text what was linked here-->

    <img src="based spongebob.png" alt="if u cant see picture, its spongebob" title="SPONGE">
    <!-- we can also add title when we hover over it to show text-->  

    <!-- lets say that we want to add picture and when someone clicks on it, it takes us to wikipedia page of him-->
    <!-- for this, we create img tag and we put it inside hyperlink tags-->
